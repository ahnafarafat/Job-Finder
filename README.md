# JobFinder â€” Flask Admin Dashboard for Job Management

A backend-focused web application built with **Flask** that powers the **Admin Dashboard** for a Job Finder platform.  
This system enables administrators to securely log in, manage job listings, and perform CRUD operations â€” all from a clean, structured dashboard interface.

---

## Project Status

**Currently in the Deployment Stage**  
- Core features are fully functional (admin login, job creation, job dashboard)  
- Bug-fixing and server configuration are in progress for production deployment on **Render**

---

## Key Features

- Secure Admin Login System (password hashing with Flask-Login)
- Add New Job Postings
- Dashboard View of All Jobs
- Login-protected Routes
- Modular Flask Application Structure using App Factory & Blueprints
- Ready for Deployment (Gunicorn + WSGI + Render)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itsahnafarafat/Website.git
cd Website
````

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Initialize the Database

```bash
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
```

### 4. Add an Admin User

```bash
python add_admin.py
```

### 5. Run the App Locally

```bash
python run.py
```

## Deployment (Render / Production)

```bash
gunicorn wsgi:app
```

Ensure `runtime.txt`, `requirements.txt`, and `wsgi.py` are included for a successful deployment to Render or similar platforms.
